    ## ANALYZE : Shape Analysis and Visualization
    Shapeworks yields relatively sparse correspondence models that may be inadequate to reconstruct 
    thin structures and high curvature regions of the underlying anatomical surfaces. 
    However, for many applications, we require a denser correspondence model, for example, 
    to construct better surface meshes, make more detailed measurements, or conduct biomechanical 
    or other simulations on mesh surfaces. One option for denser modeling is 
    to increase the number of particles per shape sample. However, this approach necessarily 
    increases the computational overhead, especially when modeling large clinical cohorts.
    Here we adopt a template-deformation approach to establish an inter-sample dense surface correspondence, 
    given a sparse set of optimized particles. To avoid introducing bias due to the template choice, we developed
    an unbiased framework for template mesh construction. The dense template mesh is then constructed 
    by triangulating the isosurface of the mean distance transform. This unbiased strategy will preserve 
    the topology of the desired anatomy  by taking into account the shape population of interest. 
    In order to recover a sample-specific surface mesh, a warping function is constructed using the 
    sample-level particle system and the mean/template particle system as control points. 
    This warping function is then used to deform the template dense mesh to the sample space.
